# ENSF409Project

For now, the main method for testing is located in Inventory.java.

On my computer (Windows), I compile and run it with the following commands:

    javac -cp .;lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar;. edu/ucalgary/ensf409/*.java
    java -cp .;lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar;. edu/ucalgary/ensf409/Inventory
